# Movies_Ranking_Web_Scraping
This a web scraping project where we can get a ranking of top movies of Netflix ranked by tomatometer.
Using the library 'Scrapy' and the terminal on Mac, introducing a variable for top, for example "10", we can get a top 10 movies.
The spider is the file "MoviesRanking.py" in MoviesRanking/MoviesRanking/spiders folder. The result can be found as "MoviesRaking.json".
A list of pictures (from Pic1-Pic5) can be found in the folder "Picture" where we can see the process since initializing the repository to running the spider.
A copy of the spider file "MoviesRanking.py" and the result "MoviesRanking.json" were uploaded in the main branch for finding easily.
